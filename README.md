# Linear Regression Tool

A simple Linear Regression Tool written in JS, HTML, and CSS that fits a line using Least Squares to bidimensional points. It provides useful metrics to understand the goodness of fit and the parameters of the line.

This tool originated from my Computer Science class at Unibo, where we learned a bit of JavaScript. At the same time, we were studying Linear Models, and this inspired me to merge the two and create something interesting. One idea for future development is to extend it to three-dimensional points, but this is still a work in progress.

To use it, simply download the repository and open the HTML file in a web browser.
